<p>Evil toasters...are they real? Many believe evil toaster are real but like anything without any actual proof there are some who are skeptical. There have been multiple records on toasters gone rogue in history. One Morgaine Foertsch one said, "I plugged it in put my dick in it and it was crispay. House burnt day ate all my cats ass and shit done ate my ass." Another case of an evil toaster was in 1984 when a woman named June O'Brien claimed her toaster was satanic. The toaster would leave messages in the toast saying <span>"SATAN LIVES"</span> She spoke about it in an interview you can watch below. Viewer dscretion is advised. Trigger warning.</p>
